A client/server implementation of a test tool using active exploitation

This is an open-source solution for organizing and trying out various exploits in the wild and serves as the backbone of a more advanced application in a private vulnerability test-suite
Note that due to security, the exploit packages are not publicly available. Nonetheless, this should be enough of a playground to serve as the infrastructure if you did want to play around with your own.
